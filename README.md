# Redux Toolkit Example
Base example of Redux Toolkit

## Folder structure
```
root-folder/
├── app/
│   └── store.js
├── features/
│   ├── feature-1/
│   └── feature-2/
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

## Slice notes
When adding a feature suffix it with Slice. This is a Redux Toolkit convention. The entire application state is split into slices and managed individually.
